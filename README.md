Udacity Project 1: Build a Portfolio Site
=========================================

This is my Project 1 submission for the Udacity Front-end Developer Course. The image  below is the design mockup which I've used to create a responsive portfolio site using HTML and CSS.

There's nothing fancy in the project. It's great practice for everyday stuff though.  To create the logo I used SVG crowbar (google it, Mike Bostock is a gawd) to pry the 'Udacity U' from the homepage then I wrapped it in a circle, chnaged the color to orange and saved the file as an SVG in Illustrator. 

To view the project please:

1. Clone the repo to a local directory
2. CD into the directory
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'grunt'
5. Open a browser to http://localhost:9000

You can also clone the repo and double-click 'index.html'.
